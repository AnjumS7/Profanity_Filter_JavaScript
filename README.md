# Profanity_Filter_JavaScript

I created the profanity filter using Node.js (JavaScript).

The repository contains two files, app.js and tweetFile.txt.
The app.js file contains the code  and the tweetFile.txt contains some random tweets.

Assumptions :
Instead of using racial slurs, I used some random words and stored them in the array named profaneWords.
The degree of profanity was measured as the number of profane words contained in the tweet. This was stored in an array named profanityCount.


How to run the code :
Clone the repository.
Make sure you have Node.js installed.
Navigate to the directory.
Run node app.js command, and it will display the profanity count of every tweet in the file.
